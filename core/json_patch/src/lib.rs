//! A module for prioritized JSON patch operations.
//!
//! This crate is designed for patching JSON structures where each patch has a
//! priority value. Conflicting patches can be resolved based on their priority.
//!
//! `Patch::One` is used for scalar fields or single-class replacements,
//! while `Patch::Seq` is used for editing arrays, with each operation targeting
//! a specific index range.
